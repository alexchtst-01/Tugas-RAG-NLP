    python testanswer.py --query "what is moon?"

result 

    Based on the context, I assume you're asking what the Moon is in a general astronomical sense. 

    The Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth, orbiting our planet at an average distance of about 239,000 miles (384,000 kilometers). It's the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and the largest satellite relative to its parent planet. The Moon is a rocky, airless body with no atmosphere, with craters, mountains, and dark volcanic maria (seas) on its surface. It affects Earth's tides, stabilizes our planet's axis, and has played a significant role in human exploration and cultural significance throughout history.
